# Mitaron: Post-COVID Stock Forecasting: An Investigation of Bayesian Methods in Machine Learning

Attempted to predict stock prices using Bayesian methods in ML models.

Datasets: (2016-2021) Nikkei225, NASDAQ, HSI, SSEC

Models: GP (Gaussian Process), SVR (Support Vector Regression), BNN, LSTM, Random Forest, XGBoost, BPS (Bayesian Predictive Synthesis)

Results: Credible intervals effectively captured future prices but could not predict them well (higher RMSE than non-Bayesian methods).
